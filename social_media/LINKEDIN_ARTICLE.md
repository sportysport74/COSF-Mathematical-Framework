**Title:** Announcing the Cosmological Synchronization Factor (COSF): A New Open-Source Mathematical Framework for Multi-Scale Resonance  Built with AI in One Day

**Article Body:**

As we step into 2026, I'm thrilled to announce the public release of the **Cosmological Synchronization Factor (COSF)**  a rigorous mathematical framework uncovering a striking numerical coincidence between the golden ratio (φ), the base of natural logarithms (e), and geophysical resonance frequencies.

**The Discovery**
COSF  5466 emerges from the ratio of ionospheric/Schumann frequencies, rendering φ and e. convergent within 0.7%  uniquely tight among extensive searches.

**What's Included**
- Complete LaTeX paper (arXiv-ready)
- Publication-quality 3D visualizations of nested φ-scaled toroidal geometry
- Exhaustive computational verification (n  200)
- Stability analysis and experimental protocols
- Full reproducibility (code, tests, notebooks)

This was built collaboratively with cutting-edge AI tools (Grok by xAI, Claude by Anthropic)  from concept to PhD-level rigor in under 24 hours on Dec 31, 2025.

It showcases the future of research: human intuition + AI acceleration + open source.

Seeking feedback from physicists, mathematicians, and engineers. Collaborations welcome!
