## Abstract

We introduce the Cosmological Synchronization Factor (COSF ≈ 5466), defined as the ratio between an upper ionospheric resonance band (≈42.8 kHz) and the fundamental Schumann resonance (≈7.83 Hz). This empirically derived constant reveals a remarkable numerical coincidence: it renders the 17th power of the golden ratio (φ  5473) and 8.6 natural exponential e-folds (e^8.6  5435) convergent to within 0.7% relative deviation.

Extensive computational searches across integer exponents n  200 and rational exponents m = p/q demonstrate that the pair (n=17, m=8.6) represents the tightest convergence in the searched domain, with no closer approximations identified under the given tolerance (δ < 0.01). This uniqueness persists across broadened parameter spaces and arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

The framework interprets this convergence geometrically through nested toroidal shells scaled by inverse powers of φ, exhibiting pentagonal symmetry and alignment with spherical harmonic decompositions. We develop complete stability criteria using Julia set boundedness (|z_n| < 2) and phase-locked loop analogues, providing quantitative thresholds for resonance coherence across the 5466 frequency span.

While rooted in observable geophysical frequencies, the framework is presented as a purely mathematical instrument for exploring relationships between algebraic irrationals, transcendental constants, and natural resonance modes. All claims are supported by:
- 10 comprehensive unit tests (pytest)
- Reproducible computational code (Python, Jupyter)
- Publication-quality visualizations
- Complete experimental protocols

This work establishes COSF as a modular, extensible methodology for investigating hidden structural alignments in mathematical physics, with potential applications in resonance modeling, number-theoretic approximations, and multi-scale synchronization phenomena.
